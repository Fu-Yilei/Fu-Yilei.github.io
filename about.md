title: About Yilei Fu
permalink: /about/
---
My name is Yile Fu (付译磊), a postdoctoral fellow at [Baylor College of Medicine, Human Genome Sequencing Center](https://www.hgsc.bcm.edu/). My research interests include cancer genomics, long-read genome-scale algorithms, epigenetic signal analysis and metagenomics.  

I graduated from [Habin Institute of Technology](http://en.hit.edu.cn/) in 2019, with a B.S. in Computer Science and Technology. Under the supervision of [Dr. Todd Treangen](https://www.treangenlab.com/) and [Dr. Fritz Sedlazeck](https://fritzsedlazeck.github.io/), I graduated from [Rice University, Computer Science Department](https://csweb.rice.edu/) in November 2023. 

At the time I am writing this post, I am sitting at my small apartment in Houston Texas, waiting my father and my cousin's visit tomorrow for my Ph.D. commencement ceremony.
