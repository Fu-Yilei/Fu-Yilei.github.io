In next several blogs, I will write things about my Ph.D. work. The first topic today is highly related to our work [Vulcan](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/10/9/giab063/6375129), which utlizes 2 different kinds of gap penalties for better long-read alignments.  
Different regions in human genome may have different mutation rates. To look at it in the population scale,
