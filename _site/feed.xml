To date, much attention has focused on analyzing structural variation in primate genomes, specifically the human genome, given the direct relevance to human health. However, recent studies have shown that structural variations (SVs) are also common in microbial communities inhabiting human hosts and can affect host health. In fact, since the first bacterial genome Haemophilus Influenza was sequenced in 1995, genome-scale structural variations in bacterial chromosomes have been investigated, including inversions, duplications, rearrangements, and deletions. SVs in bacterial genomes have been repeatedly shown to not only have a major impact on function, but also linked to strong clinical relevance such as antimicrobial resistance, heteroresistance, and virulence. Given these findings, metagenomic studies have interrogated SVs within human host associated microbiomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even very recently, structural variations in microbiomes have been linked to impacting human host health directly. In spite of these intriguing findings, SVs have not yet been comprehensively surveyed due to low resolution that short reads provide in the context of microbial communities. Also, the computational challenges in metagenomics like alignment and assembly errors require expert users to stay up to date with developments and best practice approaches. Although several methods have been proposed for SV detection in microbial genomes, these methods either are unable to detect all SV types or are limited with respect to the length of SVs they can detect. The arrival of the long read data era in metagenome sequencing provides enhanced resolution of SVs than previous short read data.&lt;br /&gt;
Here I want to list a table that include the major SV types that happens in bacteria and their machanisms, potential consequences and examples:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current methods for detection SVs in metagenomics can be divided by sequencing technologies. Short read based methods usually use k-mer based or &lt;em&gt;de bruijn&lt;/em&gt; graph-based approaches due to the limitation of the read lengths. On the other hand, long-read based methods can levearge the larger read length for better alignment or overlap graph building. Here I am attaching a figure that shows the high-level view of reference-based and assembled based methods for detection SVs in single-isolate bacterial genomes and metagenomes.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/metasv_review_methods.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt; 
&lt;strong&gt;a:&lt;/strong&gt; illustration of referenced-based SV detection methods among metagenomic sample and isolate genomes. For metagenomic samples given a read set, select proper reference genomes based on reads, then further perform split-read alignment on read set and references. The SV analysis step between reads and references is the same as SV calling on isolate genomes. &lt;strong&gt;b:&lt;/strong&gt; Long read assembly-based methods can utilize multiple sequence alignment algorithms or graph-based algorithms onto contigs or assembly graphs. &lt;strong&gt;c:&lt;/strong&gt; Short read de novo assembly usually includes k-mer counting. By generating de Bruijn graphs based on k-mers, graph-based analysis can indicate potential SV existence. &lt;strong&gt;d:&lt;/strong&gt; A scaffold graph or variation graph can be inferred from either long read assembly graphs or short read assembly graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The methods includes these approaches are shown in the following chart.
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/metasv_review_methods_chart.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till now, most of the SV detection methods in microbiomes are short-read based. However, the lack of long-range positional information brings the apparent need for long reads. Long reads can carry the ability to detect complex SVs and large size SV detection. For example, large tandem repeats extensively exist in e.coli, and those repeats can significantly improve the detection of those with the introduction of long reads. Validation is also a vital step of method detection, especially the methods that aim to solve microbiomes’ problems, given the uncertainty. Similar to the metagenome classification problem, a benchmarking dataset provides significant help for scientists to validate their methods. However, such datasets do not exist in SV detection in microbiomes. Thus the effectiveness of methods is hard to determine.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Others" /><summary type="html">We are now in the golden age of identifying genomic variation in population-scale studies.

The first topic today is highly related to our work &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/10/9/giab063/6375129&quot;&gt;Vulcan&lt;/a&gt;, which utlizes 2 different kinds of gap penalties for better long-read alignments.&lt;br /&gt;
Different regions in human genome may have different mutation rates, here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Housekeeping genes usually have low mutaion rates, which means they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14595094/&quot;&gt;evolving slower than the others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Genes involved in immune responses, tend have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/pr2004101&quot;&gt;higher mutation rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the population scale, there are also genes divergent among people such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6947201/&quot;&gt;LPA genes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874287/&quot;&gt;Cyp2d6 genes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know that long-read sequencers suffers from sequening errors, and those sequencing errors may have different effects on alignment accuracy when we are trying to align reads to these differnet regions. In this case, using the same gap penalty maybe not sufficient for all those different regions. For example, in this case, 2 different gap penalties made different choices in &lt;em&gt;EEIG2&lt;/em&gt; gene. 
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/vulcan_eeig2.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt; 
Gap penalties mainly alter the pairwise alignment behaviors in the extension stage during long-read alignment process. The state-of-the-art long-read aligners use either affine gap penalty (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lh3/minimap2&quot;&gt;minimap2&lt;/a&gt;) or convex gap penalty (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/philres/ngmlr&quot;&gt;NGMLR&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;
What is the difference between these two penalties?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Affine gap penalty calculates alignment scores as \(G(i) = g_o + g_E * i\)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convex gap penalty calculates alignment scores as \(G(i)=\left\{\begin{matrix}g_o,i=0
\\ 
G(i-1)+min\left\{\begin{matrix}g_M
\\ 
g_E+g_D*(i-1)
\end{matrix},i&amp;gt;0\right.
\end{matrix}\right.\)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In here, \(g_o\) : gap opening penalty; \(g_E\) : gap extension penalty; \(g_M\) : gap matching score; \(i\) : current length of the gap; \(g_D\) : gap decay parameter between 0 and 1; \(m\) and \(n\) are the length of two sequences.  We can clearly see that the time complexity of affine gap penalty is \(O(mn)\) while the one for convex gap penalty is \(O(mnlog(m+n))\) since it need to remember the scores from previous gaps.&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the gap decay parameter, convex gap penalty funcitons always favor larger gaps than smaller ones. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41592-018-0001-7&quot;&gt;NGMLR paper&lt;/a&gt; they claims this kind gap penalty helps long-read aligner to become more robost against sequencing errors. However, is this entirely true? We think when we are aligning reads to the regions where the sequencing errors are dominant “variants” against the reference, affine gap penalty can actually work better, and in these regions the edit distances between reads and the reference are usually low since there are fewer variations. Based on that, we can filter the read alignment that have high edit distance from minimap2 and put those into NGMLR for re-alignment.&lt;br /&gt;
Based on this motivation, we developed &lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/10/9/giab063/6375129&quot;&gt;Vulcan&lt;/a&gt;:
